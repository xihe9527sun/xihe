# Deep Code Configuration

## Configuration Hierarchy

Configuration is applied in the following priority order (lower-numbered sources are overridden by higher-numbered ones):

| Layer | Configuration Source | Description                                    |
| ----- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Defaults             | Hardcoded defaults within the application      |
| 2     | User settings file   | Global settings for the current user           |
| 3     | Project settings file| Project-specific settings                      |
| 4     | Environment variables| System-wide or session-specific variables      |

## Settings File

Deep Code uses the `settings.json` file for persistent configuration, supporting two storage locations:

| File Type           | Location                                  | Scope                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User settings file  | `~/.deepcode/settings.json`               | Applies to all Deep Code sessions for the current user.               |
| Project settings file | `<project root>/.deepcode/settings.json` | Takes effect only when running Deep Code in that specific project. Project settings override user settings. |

### Available Settings in `settings.json`

The following are all the top-level fields supported in `settings.json`, along with the sub-fields inside `env`:

| Field              | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `enabledSkills`    | object  | Per-skill enable/disable map, keyed by skill name                           |
| `statusline`       | object  | Status line plugins (see [statusline_en.md](./statusline_en.md))            |

#### `env` Sub-fields

| Field             | Type   | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MODEL`           | string | Model name, e.g. `"deepseek-v4-pro"`, `"deepseek-v4-flash"`     |
| `BASE_URL`        | string | Base URL for API requests, e.g. `"https://api.deepseek.com"`    |
| `API_KEY`         | string | API key                                                         |
| `TEMPERATURE`     | string | Sampling temperature for chat completions, from `"0"` to `"2"`  |
| `THINKING_ENABLED`| string | Enable thinking mode                                            |
| `REASONING_EFFORT`| string | Reasoning intensity                                             |
| `DEBUG_LOG_ENABLED`| string| Enable debug log output                                         |
| `TELEMETRY_ENABLED`| string| Enable anonymous usage reporting                                |
| `<any other KEY>` | string | Custom environment variable                                     |

#### `thinkingEnabled` — Thinking Mode

Whether to enable DeepSeek thinking mode. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.

- For `deepseek-v4-pro` and `deepseek-v4-flash`, thinking mode is **enabled by default**.
- For other models, thinking mode is **disabled by default**.

#### `reasoningEffort` — Reasoning Intensity

When thinking mode is enabled, controls the depth of the model’s reasoning:

| Value  | Description                                               |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max`  | Maximum reasoning depth (default)                         |
| `high` | Higher reasoning depth with relatively lower token usage  |

#### `notify` — Task Completion Notification

Set a full path to a shell script. When the AI assistant finishes a round of tasks, the script is executed automatically, which can be used to send notifications (e.g., a Slack message).

The following context is injected as environment variables when the notify script runs:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DURATION` | Session duration in seconds (integer) |
| `STATUS` | Session status: `"completed"` or `"failed"` |
| `FAIL_REASON` | Failure reason (only set on failure) |
| `BODY` | The text content of the last AI assistant reply |
| `TITLE` | Session title (matches the resume list title) |

```json
{
  "notify": "/path/to/notify-script.sh"
}
```

> For detailed configuration examples (Slack, Feishu, terminal notifications, system notifications, etc.), see [notify_en.md](notify_en.md).

#### `webSearchTool` — Custom Web Search

Deep Code has a built-in, free-to-use Web Search tool. If you need custom search logic, set `webSearchTool` to the full path of an executable script:

```json
{
  "webSearchTool": "/path/to/my-search-script.sh"
}
```

The script receives a search query as an argument and outputs results in JSON format for the AI.

#### `enabledSkills` — Skill Enablement

Controls whether skills are included during skill scanning. Keys are resolved skill names, and values must be booleans:

```json
{
  "enabledSkills": {
    "skill-writer": false,
    "code-review": true
  }
}
```

- Missing entries are enabled by default.
- Setting a skill to `false` hides every skill with that resolved `name`, across project and user skill roots.
- Project settings override user settings per skill. If the project setting omits a skill, the user setting is used.

#### `mcpServers` — MCP Servers

Configuration for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The value is a key-value pair, where the key is the service name and the value is a server configuration object.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<service name>": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| McpServerConfig field | Type     | Required | Description                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `command`             | string   | Yes      | Executable path or command (e.g. `npx`, `node`, `python`)                |
| `args`                | string[] | No       | List of arguments passed to the command                                  |
| `env`                 | object   | No       | Environment variables passed to the MCP server process                   |

> When `command` is `npx`, Deep Code automatically prepends `-y` to the arguments.

For detailed MCP usage instructions, refer to [mcp.md](mcp.md).

#### `debugLogEnabled` — Debug Log

Set to `true` to enable detailed debug logging (default `false`), useful for troubleshooting API calls and tool execution.

#### `telemetryEnabled` — Anonymous Usage Reporting

Set to `false` to disable anonymous usage reporting (default `true`). The report only includes an anonymous machine identifier and does not contain conversation content, code, or API keys.

You can also disable it via environment variable:

```bash
DEEPCODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0 deepcode
```

## Environment Variable Priority

Environment variables are a common way to configure applications, especially for sensitive information (such as api-key) or settings that may change between environments.

### Priority Principle

Environment variable priority follows the logic of “the more specific and localized the configuration, the higher the priority”, and the override rule of “env files protect existing environment by default, system variables override env files”. (The `env` object in settings.json can be thought of as a type of env file.)

Priority levels (from lowest to highest):
1. `env` defined at the top level of `settings.json` – this is a general configuration for the entire tool and all its subprocesses (global variables). Can be overridden by outer environment variables, but the environment variable KEY has the `DEEPCODE_` prefix removed.
2. `env` defined inside `mcpServers` in `settings.json` – this is the most specific configuration for a particular MCP service (local variables). Can be overridden by outer environment variables, but the KEY has the `MCP_` prefix removed.
3. Shell/system environment variables – operating system level.

### Scenarios

#### 1. Setting the model’s api_key and base_url

Applied in the following priority order (lower-numbered sources are overridden by higher-numbered ones) – using api_key as an example:

1. Hardcoded default: `""`
2. User-level settings.json: `{"env": {"API_KEY": "abc123"}}`
3. Project-level settings.json: `{"env": {"API_KEY": "abc123"}}`
4. System environment variable: `DEEPCODE_API_KEY=abc123 deepcode`

#### 2. Setting model, thinkingEnabled, and reasoningEffort

Applied in the following priority order (lower-numbered overridden by higher-numbered) – using thinkingEnabled as an example:

1. Hardcoded default: `true`
2. User-level settings.json: `{"env": {"THINKING_ENABLED": "true"}}`
3. User-level settings.json: `{"thinkingEnabled": true}`
4. Project-level settings.json: `{"env": {"THINKING_ENABLED": "true"}}`
5. Project-level settings.json: `{"thinkingEnabled": true}`
6. System environment variable: `DEEPCODE_THINKING_ENABLED=true deepcode`

#### 3. Setting environment variables for external scripts like notify and webSearchTool

Applied in the following priority order (lower-numbered overridden by higher-numbered) – using notify as an example:

1. Hardcoded default: `os.environ.get('WEBHOOK', '...')  # notify script code`
2. User-level settings.json: `{"env": {"WEBHOOK": "..."}}`
3. Project-level settings.json: `{"env": {"WEBHOOK": "true"}}`
4. System environment variable: `DEEPCODE_WEBHOOK=... deepcode`

#### 4. Setting environment variables for an MCP Service

Applied in the following priority order (lower-numbered overridden by higher-numbered) – using a GitHub MCP server as an example:

1. User-level settings.json: `{"mcpServers":{"github":{"env":{"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN":"..."}}}}`
2. User-level settings.json: `{"env": {"MCP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "..."}}`
3. Project-level settings.json: `{"mcpServers":{"github":{"env":{"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN":"..."}}}}`
4. Project-level settings.json: `{"env": {"MCP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "..."}}`
5. System environment variable: `DEEPCODE_MCP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=... deepcode`
